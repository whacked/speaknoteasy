exploring PEG. current primary interest is to read orgmode files

** links of interest:

- [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/67871][Nicolas Goaziou's amazing org syntax draft]]

- [[https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse][Instaparse]]
  
  played with amotoen for an hour; see master branch. IMHO much harder to get on the ground.

** TODO

see if any of the treetop grammar in
[[https://github.com/whacked/TreeDrunk/blob/master/orgmode.treetop][treetop grammar]]
is useful
